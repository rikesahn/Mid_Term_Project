**Midterm project for house price predictions**

By: Henrike Sahnwaldt, Enrique Hernani Ros & Rand Abu Ajamia

**Objective**: The task is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. The senior management also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tool. One of those parameters include understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - \$650K and above.

**Tools used: Python, numpy, matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, sklearn Tableau **

Steps: 

1. Exploring the data: 
	- Get rough idea of variables / features and which ones to focus on **(Weekend)**
	- Describe method **(Weekend)**
	- Explore numerical and categorical columns **(Weekend)**
	- Clean data **(Monday)**
	- Checking null values **(Monday)**
	- Visualize data to understand details **(Monday)**
	- Distribution plot **(Monday)**
	- Correlation heatmap **(Monday)**
	- Boxplots for outliers **(Monday)**

3. Prepare the data for modelling **(Monday)**
	- Dropping columns with multicorrelation
	- Transformation / processing
	- Normalization
	- Remove outliers
	- Scaling numerical variables
	- Encoding categorical variables

4. Predictive Modelling **(Tuesday)**
	- Linear regression
	- Other models necessary / useful (log regression & others in sklearn)
	- Interpret the results
	- Metrics: R-square, P-values, plot regression and errors / residuals
	- Dig deeper with the models that perform best
	- Improving the model 
	- Compare the predictions (using the same measures of accuracy as a benchmark for each model)
 	- Find model that best fits the data

5. Presentation 
	- Make a draft presentation with preliminary plots **(Wednesday)**
	- Developing visualizations with Tableau **(Wednesday)**
	- Prepare presentation **(Wednesday)**
	- Practice the presentation (2, 3 times) **(Thursday)**
	- Buffer **(Thursday)**

6. Presenting **(Friday)**
